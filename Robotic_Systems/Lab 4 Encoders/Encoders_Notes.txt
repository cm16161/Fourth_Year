~1435 encoder values per revolution
Calculated 1440 encoder values per revolution

E1 = Right
E0 = Left

When E1 = Right increments, this is equivalent to Clockwise motion
which is in the Forwards direction

When E0 = Left increments, this is equivalent to Counter-Clockwise
motion which is in the Forwards direction


As SPEED increases, it becomes harder and harder to stop movement at
exactly the specified encoder limit

Wheels are 7cm diameter
10cm = 7*pi * n_revolutions
n_revolutions = 10/(7    *pi)
n_revolutions =4.55
N_Encoder_Values = 4.55*1440 = 6538

angle/360 * (distance_between_tyres*pi)/circumference
0.25*(14pi)/7pi =4.93


Both wheels in opposite directions for 1 revolution = 180degree
rotation

n degrees/360 * 2*ONE_REVOLUTION
