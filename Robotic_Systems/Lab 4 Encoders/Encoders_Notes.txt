~1435 encoder values per revolution

E1 = Right
E0 = Left

When E1 = Right increments, this is equivalent to Clockwise motion
which is in the Forwards direction

When E0 = Left increments, this is equivalent to Counter-Clockwise
motion which is in the Forwards direction


As SPEED increases, it becomes harder and harder to stop movement at
exactly the specified encoder limit
