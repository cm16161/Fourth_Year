Timer based counting in loop is better
High speeds results in negative speed output due to overflow

Using the ISR is less accurate as the values only change when the
wheels move

So if the wheels don't move then it mis-represents the speeds.


The higher frequency of Timer3 improves the accuracy of the measured
values
