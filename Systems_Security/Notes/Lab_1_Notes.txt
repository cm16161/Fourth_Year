Initially start with randomly inputting ints and strings

Looking into GDB to get memory information

Figured out that we can crash the program via segmentation fault with
large inputs
Alternative method to cause a segfault was by arbitrarily inputting a
number, and for the string, putting in multiple consecutive %d's
followed by a %n with no spaces.

Task 1:
     i) Cause the program to crash
        - This was done by "stack smashing" by inputting an incredibly
          large intput number and string
          Alternative method uses %d's followed by %n to cause a
          segfault before printing the value
          Another alternative was to input %s until it segfaults

    ii) Print out the value of secret[1]
